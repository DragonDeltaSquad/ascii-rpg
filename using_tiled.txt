Using Tiled
===========

* 100px by 100px tiles
* xml format
* Make a layer named 'background' for all baground tiles
* Make an object layer named 'spawn' and place one object in for your default 
	spawn location (do a view>snap to grid)
* We only support these two layers.  Hopefully, we will support multi-layered
	scenes soon.
