* goals of engine.js is to provide a map api to render terrain, prevent walking into things. basic ascii-rendering map.
* creating HUD template such as bag or dialog or pause screen - make a documentated part of the api

* asciiRPG.js --> engine.js 
* sample_world.js is excellent, could perhaps split into poke_engine.js and bag functionality moved to engine.js, or when specific javascript is needed name it world.js so the we don't commit to engine.js as much and risk mixing our implementation of the engine with the engine itself.


github we need multiple branches
